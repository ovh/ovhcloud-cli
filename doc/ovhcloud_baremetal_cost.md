## ovhcloud baremetal cost

Show what a server costs and when it renews

### Synopsis

Show what a server costs and when it renews.

A server resolves to several billable services: the machine, and the
components sold with it. This lists them all, so the price shown is the
price of the machine as configured rather than of its base plan.
