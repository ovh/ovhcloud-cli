Whether you need to automate provisioning, perform quick look‑ups, or integrate OVHcloud operations into CI/CD pipelines, `ovhcloud` offers fine‑grained commands and consistent output formats (table, JSON, YAML, or custom gval expressions).

## Authenticating the CLI

OVHcloud CLI requires authentication to be able to make API calls. There are several ways to define your credentials.

Check out the [authentication page](./doc/authentication.md) for further information about the configuration and the authentication means.

* Using a configuration file:

Default settings can be set using a configuration file named `.ovh.conf` and located in your `${HOME}` directory.

Example of configuration file:

```ini
[default]
endpoint = ovh-eu

[ovh-eu]
client_id     = <OAuth 2.0 client ID>
client_secret = <OAuth 2.0 client secret>

[ovh-cli]
default_cloud_project = <public cloud project ID>
```

* Using environment variables:

```sh
OVH_ENDPOINT=ovh-eu
OVH_APPLICATION_KEY=xxx
OVH_APPLICATION_SECRET=xxx
OVH_CONSUMER_KEY=xxx
OVH_CLOUD_PROJECT_SERVICE=<public cloud project ID> 
```

* Interactive login:
```sh
# Log in and create API credentials (interactive)
ovhcloud login
```

| Reinstall a baremetal interactively      | `ovhcloud baremetal reinstall <id> --editor`    |
| List instances and filter on GRA9 region | `ovhcloud cloud instance list --filter 'region=="GRA9"'`|

# Generate Shell Completion

```sh
# Bash
eval "$(ovhcloud completion bash)"
# Zsh
eval "$(ovhcloud completion zsh)"
# Fish
ovhcloud completion fish | source
